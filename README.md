# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project 
 - Kickstarter data set; analyses by launch dates and goals.
 - The purpose of this analysis is to examine the Kickstarter projects by launch date and by goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
 - There were two analyses performed based on launched date and by goals. There were some challenges encountered during these analyses.
 - There were no challenges encountered for the analysis of the goals by based on by launch date.
 - One note of improvement would be to add data to complete the graph. For example, there are months with no cancelled data. One solution would be to add zero canceled projects during these months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 - One challenge that may need to be discussed is the goal buckets. The instructions for this analysis note to create specific buckets of goal levels. 
 - The two largest goal buckets, the "45000 to 49999" bucket and the "Greater than 50000" bucket, are specifically excluding projects with a goal of exactly $50,000. 
 - In all practical matters, one of these buckets would include this specific dollar goal. For example of a practical solution, the largest bucket should be stated as "Greater than (or equal to) 50000". 
 - In a real world analysis, this is a non-issue challenge.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   1. Most successful projects are luanched in the month of May.
   2. There are more success projects launched than failed projects. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   1. Smaller goal Kickstarter projects are more likely to be successful than larger goal Kickstarter projects. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
   1. Not all projects have the same project time length. This may or may not influence the success rates of the Kickstarter projects.  

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
   1. Count of backers vs. success/failure of project. 
   2. Country of project vs. success/failure of project.
